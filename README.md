#  End-to-End ML Pipeline â€“ Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds a **reusable and production-ready ML pipeline** using the **Scikit-learn Pipeline API** to predict **customer churn** on the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**.

---

##  Objective
- Preprocess data (handle categorical & numerical features).
- Build pipelines for models like:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
- Tune hyperparameters with **GridSearchCV**.
- Export the complete pipeline with **joblib** for easy deployment.

---

##  Features
- **Preprocessing with Pipelines**  
  - Scaling numerical features  
  - One-hot encoding categorical features  
- **Model Training**: Logistic Regression & Random Forest  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV for best performance  
- **Export**: Save trained pipeline as `.joblib` for reusability
